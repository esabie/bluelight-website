            trafficking, and to promote the commitment of Bluelight Healthcare

          <h2>4. Policy</h2>

          <p>
            4.1 It is unlikely that Bluelight Healthcare Recruitment Limited will
            experience cases of slavery or human trafficking, but this policy
            details the organisation’s commitment to raise awareness and defines a
            process to address issues if they do arise. It acknowledges that human
            trafficking and modern slavery are safeguarding matters.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.2 Slavery and human trafficking is classed as abuse. Indicators
            could include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Signs of physical or emotional abuse</li>
            <li>Appearing malnourished, unkempt or withdrawn</li>
            <li>
              Isolation from the community; seeming under the control or influence
              of others
            </li>
            <li>
              Living in dirty, cramped or overcrowded accommodation, or living and
              working at the same address
            </li>
            <li>Lack of personal effects or identification documents</li>
            <li>Always wearing the same clothes</li>
            <li>
              Avoidance of eye contact; appearing frightened or hesitant to talk
              to strangers
            </li>
            <li>Fear of law enforcers</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            4.3 All staff will be made aware of the issues surrounding slavery and
            human trafficking, and will be encouraged and supported to report any
            concerns to Bluelight management. Bluelight will support any staff who
            may be subject to slavery or human trafficking.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.4 Bluelight will ensure that only staff whose credentials can be
            confirmed are employed.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.5 In situations where slavery or human trafficking is identified,
            Bluelight will share this information with the Local Authority
            Safeguarding Team where the service user is registered, to safeguard
            individuals from harm and help prevent future situations from arising.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.6 Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 states that every
            organisation providing goods and services in the UK with a total global
            annual turnover of £36 million or more must produce a slavery and
            human trafficking statement for each financial year. Organisations
            below this threshold may produce a statement voluntarily.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.7 The £36m threshold applies to the total turnover of the organisation
            or its group, not the individual location. Publication of the annual
            statement (if applicable) is primarily the responsibility of senior
            management, but individual services will contribute to the content and
            maintain awareness of slavery and human trafficking issues.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.8 Statements should normally be published within six months of the
            financial year end.

            trafficking, are aware of any individual who may be subject to slavery
            or human trafficking, or if slavery/human trafficking is disclosed to
            them, they must inform the Registered Manager or the police.

          <h3>5.13 Incidences of Slavery and Human Trafficking</h3>

        {/* 6. DEFINITIONS */}
        <section className="asp-card" id="definitions">
          <h2>6. Definitions</h2>

          <h3>6.1 Slavery</h3>
          <p>
            In accordance with the 1926 Slavery Convention, slavery is the status
            or condition of a person over whom all or any of the powers attaching
            to the right of ownership are exercised. Although legal ownership is
            not possible, the key element is behaviour as if the offender owns the
            person, depriving the victim of their freedom.
          </p>

          <h3>6.2 Human Trafficking</h3>
          <p>
            An offence requires that a person arranges or facilitates the travel of
            another person with a view to that person being exploited. The offence
            can be committed even where the victim consents to the travel. The
            exploitation does not need to have taken place; it is enough that the
            travel was arranged with a view to exploitation (sexual or non-sexual).
          </p>

          <h3>6.3 Turnover</h3>
          <p>
            “Turnover” means the amount derived from the provision of goods and
            services falling within the ordinary activities of the commercial
            organisation or subsidiary, after deduction of trade discounts, VAT and
            other relevant taxes.
